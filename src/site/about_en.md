### **Trust**: You shouldn't have to blindly trust your vendors.

Trust is about relationships. We just provide a service, which shouldn't require implicit trust in everything you do.

People shouldn't be inhibited from doing their desired work with a service because of possible monitoring. Or the possibility of a leak, due to a hack or accident, which does happen occasionally.

### **Usability**: Encryption must not sacrifice usability.

Security sacrificing usability creates unreliable and unsafe systems. The safest solution should only require minimal effort, while producing a maximum of security.

### **Privacy**: As long as you do not give consent, your data remains private.

You may be doing shopping lists, you may be writing your will. You may be invoicing for construction work or your psychotherapy office. Your data is only yours to access until you choose to share, by creating either a shared account or creating some other kind of access for third parties.

Gaining access to your data **without your consent**, is the same as stealing your keys and breaking into your filing cabinet.

### **Control**: Your data is yours, and should always be in your control.

It shouldn't make a difference whether your data is stored offline or with an online service, it is yours to control and do with as you wish.
