	"faq_whysealas_title": "Why did we develop Sealas?",
	"faq_whysealas": "<p>We decided to develop Sealas a few years ago, when we were looking for an accounting solution for our company. One website we came across said </p><p><blockquote>Our customers have already managed 24,590,160.54 EUR.</blockquote></p><p>This was problematic for us for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>We don't want to see our financial data used for marketing.</li><li>We don't want to share our financial data with anyone we don't know and trust.</li><li>Promises in TOS and privacy policies don't protect from data leaks and curious eyes.</li></ul><p>Our first approach was a locally hosted accounting application. With time, our need for a user friendly solution grew. We wanted something we can access from anywhere.</p><p>Data privacy is important to us. Web applications usually encrypt the communication, but store all data unencrypted on their servers. We solve this problem by encrypting all data before it even gets sent to us. </p><p>We don't even need to promise to handle your data confidentially. We simply don't have any access.</p><p>Our goal is for Sealas to be as easy and comfortable to use as possible.</p>",
	"faq_encryption_title": "How does my data get encrypted?",
	"faq_encryption": "<p>With the creation of your account, we generate a unique key for you which is saved on our servers encrypted with your password. With this key, all your data gets encrypted on your browser before it's sent to the server. All communication to the server is of course secured with HTTPS.</p><p>In detail: your password is hashed via PBKDF2 on the client and again with Bcrypt on the server. This way, we never have access to your password in cleartext. We use a symmetrical encryption method (AES). The key is secured with the hashed password. The key itself is used for securing all data on the client side, which later gets sent to the server.</p>",
	"faq_lostpassword_title": "What happens if I lose my password?",
	"faq_lostpassword": "<p>We have prepared a few safeguards in case you forget your password:</p><ul><li>You can set a hint for your password, which you can send to your email address at any time.</li><li>When you login with your browser, a safety key will be created. With this key you can log in once to change your password.</li><li>When creating an account, you can backup your key as a QR code by printing it or downloading it. You can also do this at any time in your account settings. With this QR code you can recover access to your account at any time.</li></ul><p>We neither have access to your password, nor can we change your password. The aforementioned methods are there to help you in case you forget or lose your password, and to prevent any data loss.</p>",
